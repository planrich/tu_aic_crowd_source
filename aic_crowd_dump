Concerns about weak growth in China  — a critical market for Western trade — melded with currency drops in countries such as Turkey, prompting investors to flee from stocks, which are viewed as riskier than bonds or gold. The S&P 500, a broad measure of the American market, lost 2.1% to 1,790 Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.2% to 4,128. On both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, about 85% of all stocks declined.Among the Dow's 30 members, only three escaped the session with gains — Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT) and Procter & Gamble (PG). General Electric (GE), 3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) were three of the hardest hit, each falling around 3%. The last time the Dow had a single day that was worse came on June 20, when it gave up 354 points, FactSet data show.

Microsoft’s hardware efforts, old and new, also came in above expectations but, again, digging into the details reveals more weakness.\n\nFor example, the company said it sold 7.4 million Xbox gaming consoles. But only 3.9 million were the new Xbox One – the rest were sales of the prior model. Xbox One consoles carry a negligible profit margin but should lead to sales of much higher-margin new games and online services down the road. The older Xbox 360 boxes, based on a design that’s now essentially nine years old, have a much higher immediate profit margin, helping this quarter's bottom line. But they won’t bring in nearly as much in future game sales, as the owners won’t be able to run fancy new games created for the new platform.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/7/answers	t	0.0800000000000000017	0

It’s good that Surface tablets are selling better but Hood admitted the effort is still losing money. And the numbers are still so miniscule as to be almost irrelevant in the overall tablet market. In the third quarter – before the holiday shopping period – Apple sold 14.1 million iPads worth $6.2 billion. It’s expected to report selling 23 million to 25 million worth well over $10 billion for the holiday period.

13_2	2014-01-25 00:17:03.883318	Is Facebook mentioned in this text positive, neutral or negative?	After a year of triple-digit gains for the likes of Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Best Buy (BBY), and Facebook (FB), investors are busy trying to find the next big winner. According to Joe Fahmy, managing director at Zor Capital, these so-called “momentum plays” typically have two common traits.“On the fundamental side, their earnings and sales are accelerating,” Fahmy says in the attached video. “And on the technical side, they’re usually breaking out of some sort of technical pattern and moving to the upside.”With that in mind, Fahmy brought a list of ideas to Breakout that he thinks could fit the bill and deliver the kind of upside investor dream of.Fahmy’s first pick is hardly a new theme but it is clearly showing renewed signs of momentum. While the Biotech sector (IBB)  has been rising and setting record highs for six years, its recent surge looks to be accelerating. Specifically, the sector gained 65% last year and 32% the year before, but a two-month sprint of close to 20%, (representing 4x outperformance versus the S&P 500) is a sign that better days are ahead.“I still think it’s in a great uptrend,” says Fahmy in the attached video.  “A lot of the companies (in it) still have powerful earnings growth, huge pipelines of (new) drugs and will continue to grow through acquisition. I think some of the bigger names (CELG, GILD, AMGN, BIIB) will be bigger than Merck or Pfizer 3 to 5 years from now.”Fahmy also see lots of blossoming growth within tech right now, particularly amongst companies that manage and manipulate so called “big data.” One such momentum play that he likes is a company called Splunk (SPLK). Since its debut in April 2012, this San Francisco based provider of operational intelligence has risen more than 140% “Every deal that’s going on in big data, meaning the indexing of all this data, Splunk is involved,” Fahmy says. “They’re the leader and the main company in this space.” For the record, Splunk is forecast to deliver 66% EPS growth this quarter and 40% sales growth.The final so-called ‘mo-mo’ pick from Fahmy is a play on the boom in data and internet security. Again, he has chosen to play it via a new but rapidly growing company called FireEye (FEYE).  “It’s made a big run recently,“ he says of the stock which came public at $20 four months ago and closed yesterday at $70. “Longer term I think this is one of the biggest players, and you’re (still) getting this early.”He’s the first to admit that these types of stocks often ‘’get ahead of themselves” and that would-be buyers need to be on the look out for dips and consolidations. In fact, just this week, JPMorgan downgraded FireEye to neutral from overweight in the wake of its huge short-term move. “Fundamentally, these companies are the new growth names,” he says, noting that most investors still aren’t familiar with them. “As you research them and get to know their stories, you’ll find that these are big winners potentially in the long term.”\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/13/answers	t	0.309999999999999998	0

13_1	2014-01-25 00:17:03.69369	Is Facebook mentioned in this text positive, neutral or negative?	After a year of triple-digit gains for the likes of Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Best Buy (BBY), and Facebook (FB), investors are busy trying to find the next big winner. According to Joe Fahmy, managing director at Zor Capital, these so-called “momentum plays” typically have two common traits.“On the fundamental side, their earnings and sales are accelerating,” Fahmy says in the attached video. “And on the technical side, they’re usually breaking out of some sort of technical pattern and moving to the upside.”With that in mind, Fahmy brought a list of ideas to Breakout that he thinks could fit the bill and deliver the kind of upside investor dream of.Fahmy’s first pick is hardly a new theme but it is clearly showing renewed signs of momentum. While the Biotech sector (IBB)  has been rising and setting record highs for six years, its recent surge looks to be accelerating. Specifically, the sector gained 65% last year and 32% the year before, but a two-month sprint of close to 20%, (representing 4x outperformance versus the S&P 500) is a sign that better days are ahead.“I still think it’s in a great uptrend,” says Fahmy in the attached video.  “A lot of the companies (in it) still have powerful earnings growth, huge pipelines of (new) drugs and will continue to grow through acquisition. I think some of the bigger names (CELG, GILD, AMGN, BIIB) will be bigger than Merck or Pfizer 3 to 5 years from now.”Fahmy also see lots of blossoming growth within tech right now, particularly amongst companies that manage and manipulate so called “big data.” One such momentum play that he likes is a company called Splunk (SPLK). Since its debut in April 2012, this San Francisco based provider of operational intelligence has risen more than 140% “Every deal that’s going on in big data, meaning the indexing of all this data, Splunk is involved,” Fahmy says. “They’re the leader and the main company in this space.” For the record, Splunk is forecast to deliver 66% EPS growth this quarter and 40% sales growth.The final so-called ‘mo-mo’ pick from Fahmy is a play on the boom in data and internet security. Again, he has chosen to play it via a new but rapidly growing company called FireEye (FEYE).  “It’s made a big run recently,“ he says of the stock which came public at $20 four months ago and closed yesterday at $70. “Longer term I think this is one of the biggest players, and you’re (still) getting this early.”He’s the first to admit that these types of stocks often ‘’get ahead of themselves” and that would-be buyers need to be on the look out for dips and consolidations. In fact, just this week, JPMorgan downgraded FireEye to neutral from overweight in the wake of its huge short-term move. “Fundamentally, these companies are the new growth names,” he says, noting that most investors still aren’t familiar with them. “As you research them and get to know their stories, you’ll find that these are big winners potentially in the long term.”\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/13/answers	t	0.309999999999999998	0

Of all the sexy growth stories vying for attention in the tech sector, none is as boldly opportunistic as Microsoft’s (MSFT) new effort to tap into growing global outrage over spying by the National Security Agency.In an unprecedented move, Microsoft is now offering its customers abroad to choose where they would like to have their data stored, and comes as the backlash over U.S. surveillance operations intensifies.“People should have the ability to make an informed choice of where their data resides," said Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith yesterday.As my co-host Jeff Macke and I discuss in the attached video, the action by the software giant may be the first of its kind, but is surely won’t be the last. In fact, by getting a jump on its industry rivals, Microsoft is making a shrewd business decision that could pay off in spades.In addition, Microsoft’s pushback comes on the very same day that the government’s new privacy watchdog is set to release a report that calls the NSA’s indiscriminate data gathering illegal, scarcely effective and calls for it to be closed down. So far, President Obama and anti-terrorism operatives have given almost no ground in the face of public protestations over the program. As recently as last week, the President sought to soothe concerns in an address to the nation on the issue, but polls show what little he offered in the form of concessions or curtailment did nothing to sway opinion.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/47/answers	t	0.149999999999999994	0

The extreme activist proceeded to argue that Apple should capitalize on "advancements in miniaturization and continued improvements in Siri" to produce an extended list of products from wearable gadgets to televisions.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/55/answers	t	0.0700000000000000067	0

Concerns about weak growth in China  — a critical market for Western trade — melded with currency drops in countries such as Turkey, prompting investors to flee from stocks, which are viewed as riskier than bonds or gold. The S&P 500, a broad measure of the American market, lost 2.1% to 1,790 Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.2% to 4,128. On both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, about 85% of all stocks declined.Among the Dow's 30 members, only three escaped the session with gains — Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT) and Procter & Gamble (PG). General Electric (GE), 3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) were three of the hardest hit, each falling around 3%. The last time the Dow had a single day that was worse came on June 20, when it gave up 354 points, FactSet data show. On Thursday the index skidded 176 points, so its two-day loss is now 494 points, taking it to 15,879.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/80/answers	t	0.0899999999999999967	0

Microsoft’s hardware efforts, old and new, also came in above expectations but, again, digging into the details reveals more weakness.\n\nFor example, the company said it sold 7.4 million Xbox gaming consoles. But only 3.9 million were the new Xbox One – the rest were sales of the prior model. Xbox One consoles carry a negligible profit margin but should lead to sales of much higher-margin new games and online services down the road. The older Xbox 360 boxes, based on a design that’s now essentially nine years old, have a much higher immediate profit margin, helping this quarter's bottom line. But they won’t bring in nearly as much in future game sales, as the owners won’t be able to run fancy new games created for the new platform.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/85/answers	t	0.0800000000000000017	0

Unfortunately, the surprise was all on the corporate side, where Microsoft’s decision to end support for Windows XP last year has given sales a short-term bump. Windows 8 remains a controversial product and some analysts say many companies have been asking to install Windows 7 when they upgrade.

Microsoft’s hardware efforts, old and new, also came in above expectations but, again, digging into the details reveals more weakness.\n\nFor example, the company said it sold 7.4 million Xbox gaming consoles. But only 3.9 million were the new Xbox One – the rest were sales of the prior model. Xbox One consoles carry a negligible profit margin but should lead to sales of much higher-margin new games and online services down the road. The older Xbox 360 boxes, based on a design that’s now essentially nine years old, have a much higher immediate profit margin, helping this quarter's bottom line. But they won’t bring in nearly as much in future game sales, as the owners won’t be able to run fancy new games created for the new platform.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/85/answers	t	0.0800000000000000017	0

It’s good that Surface tablets are selling better but Hood admitted the effort is still losing money. And the numbers are still so miniscule as to be almost irrelevant in the overall tablet market. In the third quarter – before the holiday shopping period – Apple sold 14.1 million iPads worth $6.2 billion. It’s expected to report selling 23 million to 25 million worth well over $10 billion for the holiday period.

90_1	2014-01-25 12:41:32.524781	Is Facebook mentioned in this text positive, neutral or negative?	After a year of triple-digit gains for the likes of Netflix (NFLX), Tesla (TSLA), Best Buy (BBY), and Facebook (FB), investors are busy trying to find the next big winner. According to Joe Fahmy, managing director at Zor Capital, these so-called “momentum plays” typically have two common traits.“On the fundamental side, their earnings and sales are accelerating,” Fahmy says in the attached video. “And on the technical side, they’re usually breaking out of some sort of technical pattern and moving to the upside.”With that in mind, Fahmy brought a list of ideas to Breakout that he thinks could fit the bill and deliver the kind of upside investor dream of.Fahmy’s first pick is hardly a new theme but it is clearly showing renewed signs of momentum. While the Biotech sector (IBB)  has been rising and setting record highs for six years, its recent surge looks to be accelerating. Specifically, the sector gained 65% last year and 32% the year before, but a two-month sprint of close to 20%, (representing 4x outperformance versus the S&P 500) is a sign that better days are ahead.“I still think it’s in a great uptrend,” says Fahmy in the attached video.  “A lot of the companies (in it) still have powerful earnings growth, huge pipelines of (new) drugs and will continue to grow through acquisition. I think some of the bigger names (CELG, GILD, AMGN, BIIB) will be bigger than Merck or Pfizer 3 to 5 years from now.”Fahmy also see lots of blossoming growth within tech right now, particularly amongst companies that manage and manipulate so called “big data.” One such momentum play that he likes is a company called Splunk (SPLK). Since its debut in April 2012, this San Francisco based provider of operational intelligence has risen more than 140% “Every deal that’s going on in big data, meaning the indexing of all this data, Splunk is involved,” Fahmy says. “They’re the leader and the main company in this space.” For the record, Splunk is forecast to deliver 66% EPS growth this quarter and 40% sales growth.The final so-called ‘mo-mo’ pick from Fahmy is a play on the boom in data and internet security. Again, he has chosen to play it via a new but rapidly growing company called FireEye (FEYE).  “It’s made a big run recently,“ he says of the stock which came public at $20 four months ago and closed yesterday at $70. “Longer term I think this is one of the biggest players, and you’re (still) getting this early.”He’s the first to admit that these types of stocks often ‘’get ahead of themselves” and that would-be buyers need to be on the look out for dips and consolidations. In fact, just this week, JPMorgan downgraded FireEye to neutral from overweight in the wake of its huge short-term move. “Fundamentally, these companies are the new growth names,” he says, noting that most investors still aren’t familiar with them. “As you research them and get to know their stories, you’ll find that these are big winners potentially in the long term.”\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/90/answers	t	0.309999999999999998	0

So far, President Obama and anti-terrorism operatives have given almost no ground in the face of public protestations over the program. As recently as last week, the President sought to soothe concerns in an address to the nation on the issue, but polls show what little he offered in the form of concessions or curtailment did nothing to sway opinion.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/123/answers	f	0.149999999999999994	0

In fact, a new poll from USA Today shows a majority of Americans are against the President on the surveillance program and have little confidence that policies will be changed. One can only presume that an equally large number of non-Americans are opposed to it as well, which is why Microsoft is stepping up to meet demand.To be fair, even if Microsoft - or other companies - start to house more data offshore, it would seem at best to be ineffective given the NSA’s widely reported foreign data collection operations in places like Brazil and Europe. There’s also the unsettling reality that the government can always demand access to the data if and when it feels the need.“What the government has done is to create a market opportunity for companies to go offshore with this data,” Macke declares. “It’s a curious turn of events.”\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/124/answers	f	0.0899999999999999967	0

Concerns about weak growth in China  — a critical market for Western trade — melded with currency drops in countries such as Turkey, prompting investors to flee from stocks, which are viewed as riskier than bonds or gold. The S&P 500, a broad measure of the American market, lost 2.1% to 1,790 Friday, and the Nasdaq Composite slid 2.2% to 4,128. On both the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, about 85% of all stocks declined.Among the Dow's 30 members, only three escaped the session with gains — Merck (MRK), Microsoft (MSFT) and Procter & Gamble (PG). General Electric (GE), 3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) were three of the hardest hit, each falling around 3%. The last time the Dow had a single day that was worse came on June 20, when it gave up 354 points, FactSet data show.

As recently as last week, the President sought to soothe concerns in an address to the nation on the issue, but polls show what little he offered in the form of concessions or curtailment did nothing to sway opinion.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/47/answers	t	0.149999999999999994	0

Microsoft’s hardware efforts, old and new, also came in above expectations but, again, digging into the details reveals more weakness.\n\nFor example, the company said it sold 7.4 million Xbox gaming consoles. But only 3.9 million were the new Xbox One – the rest were sales of the prior model. Xbox One consoles carry a negligible profit margin but should lead to sales of much higher-margin new games and online services down the road. The older Xbox 360 boxes, based on a design that’s now essentially nine years old, have a much higher immediate profit margin, helping this quarter's bottom line. But they won’t bring in nearly as much in future game sales, as the owners won’t be able to run fancy new games created for the new platform.\n	Positive|Neutral|Negative	http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/tasks/85/answers	t	0.0800000000000000017	0
